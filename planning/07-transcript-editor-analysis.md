# Transcript Editor Analysis & Build Strategy

## Audapolis Deep Dive

### What It Is

- Open-source transcript-based media editor (AGPL-3.0 license)
- Built with TypeScript (89.5%) and Python (6.4%)
- Cross-platform: Windows, Mac, Linux
- 1.7k GitHub stars, German government-funded initially
- Last release: v0.3.0 (July 2023) - **Not actively maintained**

### Architecture

```text
audapolis/
├── app/          # TypeScript/Electron frontend
├── server/       # Python transcription backend
└── Uses PyQt5 for some components
```

### What It Does Well

- ✅ **Exactly what we need**: Edit audio/video by editing transcript
- ✅ Local-first, no cloud dependency
- ✅ Word-level sync between text and audio
- ✅ Multi-track support
- ✅ Speaker detection/labeling
- ✅ Export capabilities

### Limitations for Our Use Case

- ❌ No character-specific extraction features
- ❌ No built-in voice enhancement
- ❌ Uses older ASR models (not Whisper)
- ❌ General-purpose, not optimized for dialogue extraction
- ❌ 1+ year since last update (potential security/compatibility issues)

## Other Open-Source Findings

### 1. **NYPL Transcript Editor**

- Rails-based collaborative transcript correction tool
- Not suitable - focused on crowdsourcing corrections, not editing

### 2. **BBC Transcript Editor (Archived)**

- Similar to NYPL's approach
- Abandoned in 2019

### 3. **No True Open-Source Descript Clones!**

- FireCut, Kapwing, etc. are all commercial
- Your observation is correct: many YouTube demos, zero open source

## Build Strategy Recommendation

### Option A: Fork & Modernize Audapolis

**Pros:**

- Immediate working transcript editor
- Proven sync algorithm
- Cross-platform ready

**Cons:**  

- Technical debt from outdated dependencies
- Need to understand someone else's architecture
- AGPL license (viral for commercial use)

**Work Required:**

- Update Electron & dependencies
- Replace transcription with Whisper
- Add character extraction features
- Implement audio enhancement pipeline

### Option B: Build Custom (Recommended)

**Pros:**

- Exact features for our use case
- Modern tech stack from day 1
- Choose our own license
- Optimized for character extraction

**Cons:**

- More initial work
- Need to solve sync algorithms

**Tech Stack:**

```javascript
// Core Components
{
  waveform: "wavesurfer.js",      // Proven, actively maintained
  textEditor: "monaco-editor",     // VS Code's editor
  sync: "custom implementation",   // Based on word timings
  framework: "Electron or Tauri",  
  backend: "Python FastAPI"
}
```

### Option C: Hybrid Approach

Study Audapolis's code for:

- Sync algorithm implementation
- UI/UX patterns that work
- File format handling

But build fresh with:

- Modern dependencies
- Character-focused features
- Our specific workflow

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Audio-Text Synchronization

```javascript
// Simplified sync approach
interface WordTiming {
  word: string;
  start: number;  // seconds
  end: number;
  confidence: number;
  speaker?: string;
}

// Click word → seek audio
// Select text → select audio region
// Edit text → mark for re-sync
```

### 2. Character Extraction UI

```javascript
// Character-specific features needed
interface CharacterSegment {
  character: string;
  text: string;
  audioStart: number;
  audioEnd: number;
  videoFile?: string;
  enhanced?: boolean;
}
```

### 3. Performance with Long Media

- Virtualized transcript rendering (only render visible)
- Chunked waveform loading
- Background processing for enhancement
- Progressive loading for 2+ hour movies

## Why "Transcript Editing is Where the Money Is"

You're absolutely right! Here's why:

1. **It's the UX differentiator** - Makes pro editing accessible
2. **Complex to build well** - Sync, performance, edge cases
3. **Not commoditized** - No good open-source options
4. **High value** - Saves hours of manual work
5. **Network effects** - Better transcripts → better models → better UX

## Immediate Next Steps

### Week 1: Proof of Concept

- [ ] Basic Electron/Tauri app with movie file import
- [ ] Whisper transcription integration
- [ ] Simple text display synced to audio playback
- [ ] Character labeling interface

### Week 2: Core Editing

- [ ] Wavesurfer.js integration
- [ ] Monaco editor with custom syntax highlighting
- [ ] Click-to-seek functionality
- [ ] Text selection → audio selection

### Decision Point

After 2 weeks, evaluate:

- Is our custom solution on track?
- Should we pivot to forking Audapolis?
- Any technical blockers?

## Conclusion

Building custom is more work initially but gives us:

1. **Exact workflow** for character extraction
2. **Modern, maintainable codebase**
3. **Ownership** of the core differentiator
4. **Flexibility** to add unique features

The transcript editor truly is "where the money is" - it's the foundation that makes everything else possible. Once we nail this, the rest (enhancement, cloning, assistant) are well-solved problems we can integrate.
