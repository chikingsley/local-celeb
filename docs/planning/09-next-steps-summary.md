# Next Steps Summary - Let's Build This

## What We've Learned

### The Big Insight

You're 100% right - **transcript-based character extraction is "where the money is"**. It's the hardest part, the most valuable, and surprisingly, nobody has open-sourced it yet. This is your differentiator.

### Key Findings

- **Audapolis** is the closest open-source solution, but it's outdated and not character-focused
- **No true open-source Descript alternatives exist** (despite all the YouTube demos)
- **The tech stack is clear**: Electron/Tauri + Wavesurfer.js + Monaco Editor + Python backend
- **Models are solved**: Whisper for ASR, Orpheus/Kokoro for TTS, Ollama for LLMs

## Immediate Action Items (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Foundation

- [ ] **Decision**: Electron vs Tauri
  - Electron if you want MacWhisper-like experience
  - Tauri if you want lighter/faster
- [ ] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Create window with native menu bar
- [ ] Add file picker for movie import

### Day 3-4: Core Proof of Concept

- [ ] Integrate Whisper.cpp for transcription
- [ ] Display transcript in basic text view
- [ ] Sync playback (click text â†’ hear audio)
- [ ] Add character name labels

### Day 5-7: The "Money" Feature

- [ ] Add character dropdown filter
- [ ] Implement "Export all Scar lines" button
- [ ] Basic waveform view with Wavesurfer.js
- [ ] Test with Lion King!

## Technical Starting Point

```bash
# Project structure
cinematic-voice-weaver/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main/           # Electron/Tauri main process
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ renderer/       # UI (React/Vue/Vanilla)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ editor/         # Transcript editor logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/           # Python FastAPI backend
â”œâ”€â”€ models/            # Downloaded AI models
â”œâ”€â”€ projects/          # User projects
â””â”€â”€ exports/          # Extracted character audio
```

## Questions Answered

### Q: Fork Audapolis or build custom?

**A: Build custom.** Audapolis is too outdated and general-purpose. You need character-focused features from day one.

### Q: What about Hammerspoon?

**A: Skip it for the main app.** It's for macOS automation, not app development. Maybe useful later for global hotkeys.

### Q: How to organize this project?

**A: You now have:**

- `06-cinematic-voice-weaver-roadmap.md` - Full project plan with phases
- `07-transcript-editor-analysis.md` - Deep dive on the core editor
- `08-character-llm-finetuning.md` - Your innovative LLM idea
- `09-next-steps-summary.md` - This action plan

## The Path Forward

### Week 1: Validate Core Concept

Build the simplest thing that proves the idea:

1. Load movie + subtitle file
2. Show transcript with character names
3. Click button â†’ export character audio
4. If this feels magical, continue!

### Week 2: Make It Real

Add the features that matter:

- Waveform visualization
- Proper time-sync editing
- Basic audio enhancement
- Progress toward TTS training

### Week 3: Close the Loop

- Train first voice model
- Basic chat interface
- Character speaks with cloned voice
- ðŸŽ‰ You've built something nobody else has!

## Your Unique Advantages

1. **Clear Vision**: Extract character voices for AI assistants
2. **Technical Insight**: Transcript editing is the key differentiator  
3. **Model Knowledge**: You've already identified the best TTS options
4. **User Empathy**: You've felt the pain of manual extraction

## Final Recommendations

### Start With

- Electron (familiar to Mac app users)
- TypeScript (type safety for complex app)
- Wavesurfer.js (proven waveform library)
- FastAPI (Python backend for AI models)

### Avoid For Now

- Perfect UI (function over form initially)
- Multiple character support (nail one first)
- Advanced features (streaming, fine-tuning)
- Distribution concerns (build first)

### Remember

- **This is Day 1 stuff** - You can build the MVP this week
- **Perfect is the enemy of done** - Ship the character extractor first
- **You're solving a real problem** - Hours of manual work â†’ minutes
- **The community needs this** - Open source it when ready!

## Let's Go! ðŸš€

The planning is done. You have everything you need. The next step is to open your code editor and start building. Begin with the simplest possible movie â†’ character audio pipeline, and iterate from there.

**First line of code to write:**

```javascript
// main.js
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
// Your journey begins here...
```
