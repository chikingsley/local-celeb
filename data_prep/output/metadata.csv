output/audio/segment_0.wav,"Life's not fair, is it?"
output/audio/segment_1.wav,"You see, I... well, I shall never be king, ha."
output/audio/segment_2.wav,And you shall never see the light of another day.
output/audio/segment_3.wav,"And you, what do you want?"
output/audio/segment_4.wav,"Oh, now look Zazu, you've made me lose my lunch."
output/audio/segment_5.wav,"Ooh, I quiver with fear."
output/audio/segment_6.wav,"Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners."
output/audio/segment_7.wav,"That was today? Oh, I feel simply awe. Yes."
output/audio/segment_8.wav,Must've slipped my mind.
output/audio/segment_9.wav,"Well, I was first in line until the little hair ball was born."
output/audio/segment_10.wav,"Oh, I shall practice my curtesy."
output/audio/segment_11.wav,"Oh no, Mufasa, perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me."
output/audio/segment_12.wav,"Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you."
output/audio/segment_13.wav,"Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But when it comes to brute strength,"
output/audio/segment_14.wav,I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool.
output/audio/segment_15.wav,I despise guessing games.
output/audio/segment_16.wav,"Oh, goody."
output/audio/segment_17.wav,"Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know."
output/audio/segment_18.wav,A monkey's uncle.
output/audio/segment_19.wav,You have no idea.
output/audio/segment_20.wav,"So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he?"
output/audio/segment_21.wav,He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border...
output/audio/segment_22.wav,"And he's absolutely right, far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there."
output/audio/segment_23.wav,"I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you."
output/audio/segment_24.wav,"Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out for the wellbeing of my favorite nephew."
output/audio/segment_25.wav,All the more reason for me to be protective.
output/audio/segment_26.wav,An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince.
output/audio/segment_27.wav,"Oops. Oh, dear, I've said too much."
output/audio/segment_28.wav,"Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all."
output/audio/segment_29.wav,Just do me one favor. Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place.
output/audio/segment_30.wav,"There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun, and remember, it's our little secret."
output/audio/segment_31.wav,"Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad."
output/audio/segment_32.wav,I see.
output/audio/segment_33.wav,I'm surrounded by idiots.
output/audio/segment_34.wav,Precisely.
output/audio/segment_35.wav,"Now, you wait here."
output/audio/segment_36.wav,Your father has a marvelous surprise for you.
output/audio/segment_37.wav,"If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it?"
output/audio/segment_38.wav,You are such a naughty boy!
output/audio/segment_39.wav,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is just for you and your daddy."
output/audio/segment_40.wav,"You know, a sort of father, son thing."
output/audio/segment_41.wav,"Well, I'd better go get him."
output/audio/segment_43.wav,"No, just stay on this rock."
output/audio/segment_44.wav,You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas.
output/audio/segment_45.wav,"Simba, everybody knows about that."
output/audio/segment_46.wav,"Oh, yes, lucky daddy was there to save you, eh?"
output/audio/segment_47.wav,"Ooh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm?"
output/audio/segment_48.wav,"Simba, it's to die for."
output/audio/segment_50.wav,"Of course, of course you didn't."
output/audio/segment_51.wav,No one ever means for these things to happen.
output/audio/segment_52.wav,But the king is dead.
output/audio/segment_53.wav,"And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive."
output/audio/segment_55.wav,what will your mother think?
output/audio/segment_58.wav,Kill him.
output/audio/segment_59.wav,Mufasa's death was a terrible tragedy.
output/audio/segment_60.wav,"But to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live..."
output/audio/segment_61.wav,"For me, it is a deep, personal loss."
output/audio/segment_62.wav,"So, it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne."
output/audio/segment_63.wav,"Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future."
output/audio/segment_65.wav,"Oh, Zazu, do lighten up."
output/audio/segment_66.wav,Sing something with a little bounce in it.
output/audio/segment_68.wav,It's the lioness' job to do the hunting.
output/audio/segment_69.wav,"Oh, eat Zazu."
output/audio/segment_70.wav,"Ooh Zazu, don't be ridiculous."
output/audio/segment_72.wav,Good. Now get out.
output/audio/segment_74.wav,Where is your hunting party? They're not doing their jobs.
output/audio/segment_75.wav,"No, you're just not looking hard enough."
output/audio/segment_76.wav,We're not going anywhere.
output/audio/segment_77.wav,Then so be it.
output/audio/segment_78.wav,I am the king. I can do whatever I want.
output/audio/segment_81.wav,"Simba? Simba, I'm a little surprised to see you... alive."
output/audio/segment_83.wav,"Simba, you must understand the pressures of ruling a kingdom."
output/audio/segment_85.wav,"However, there is one little problem. You see them?"
output/audio/segment_86.wav,They think I'm king.
output/audio/segment_87.wav,"Oh, must this all end in violence?"
output/audio/segment_88.wav,I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member.
output/audio/segment_89.wav,"Wouldn't you agree, Simba?"
output/audio/segment_90.wav,"But what about your faithful subjects, have they put it behind them?"
output/audio/segment_91.wav,"Ah, so you haven't told them your little secret."
output/audio/segment_92.wav,"Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them."
output/audio/segment_93.wav,Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death.
output/audio/segment_94.wav,You see? He admits it.
output/audio/segment_99.wav,"But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why."
output/audio/segment_100.wav,"Now, this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before? Let me think."
output/audio/segment_101.wav,"Ooh, yes, I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died."
output/audio/segment_102.wav,And here's my little secret.
output/audio/segment_104.wav,"No, Simba, please."
output/audio/segment_107.wav,"Simba, Simba, please. Please have mercy. I beg you."
output/audio/segment_109.wav,It was their fault.
output/audio/segment_111.wav,What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your own uncle?
output/audio/segment_112.wav,"Oh, Simba, thank you."
output/audio/segment_113.wav,"You are truly noble. I'll make it up to you, I promise. And how can I, uh, prove myself to you? Tell me. I mean, anything."
output/audio/segment_114.wav,"Yes, of course."
output/audio/segment_116.wav,"Oh, my friend."
