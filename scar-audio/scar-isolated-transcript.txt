00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:10,599 [Scar]
Life's not fair, is it? You see, I... well, I shall never be king, ha [sucks teeth]. And you 

00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:36,840 [Scar]
shall never see the light of another day [laughs]. And you, what do you want? Oh, now look Zazu, you've made me lose my lunch. Ooh, I quiver with fear. Why, if it isn't my big brother descending from on high to mingle with the commoners. That was today? Oh, I feel simply awe. Yes. 

00:00:36,840 --> 00:01:01,759 [Scar]
Must've slipped my mind. Well, I was first in line until the little hair ball was born. Oh, I shall practice my curtesy. Oh no, Mufasa, perhaps you shouldn't turn your back on me. Temper, temper. I wouldn't dream of challenging you. Well, as far as brains go, I got the lion's share. But when it comes to brute strength, 

00:01:01,759 --> 00:02:44,999 [Scar]
I'm afraid I'm at the shallow end of the gene pool. I despise guessing games. Oh, goody. Yes. Well, forgive me for not leaping for joy. Bad back, you know. A monkey's uncle. You have no idea. So, your father showed you the whole kingdom, did he? He didn't show you what's beyond that rise at the northern border? And he's absolutely right, far too dangerous. Only the bravest lions go there. I'm sorry, Simba, I just can't tell you. Simba, Simba, I'm only looking out for the wellbeing of my favorite nephew. All the more reason for me to be protective. An elephant graveyard is no place for a young prince. Aw. Oh, dear, I've said too much. Well, I suppose you'd have found out sooner or later, you being so clever and all. Just do me one favor. Promise me you'll never visit that dreadful place. There's a good lad. You run along now and have fun, and remember, it's our little secret. Oh, surely we lions are not all that bad. I see, I'm surrounded by idiots. Precisely. Now, you wait here. Your father has a marvelous surprise for you. If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise, now would it? [laughs] You are such a naughty boy. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, this is just for you and your daddy. You know, a sort of father, son thing. Well, I'd better go get him. No [laughs]. 

00:02:44,999 --> 00:03:12,919 [Scar]
No, just stay on this rock. You wouldn't want to end up in another mess like you did with the hyenas. Simba, everybody knows about that. Oh, yes, lucky Daddy was there to save you, eh? [laughs] Ooh, and just between us, you might want to work on that little roar of yours, hmm? Simba, it's to die for. Simba, 

00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,559 [Scar]
what have you done? 

00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:28,639 [Scar]
Of course, of course you didn't. No one ever means for these things to happen. But the king is dead. 

00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:38,939 [Scar]
And if it weren't for you, he'd still be alive. Oh, what will your mother think? [crying] Run away, Simba. 

00:03:38,939 --> 00:03:48,779 [Scar]
Run, run away and never return. Kill him. Mufasa's death was a terrible tragedy, 

00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:53,799 [Scar]
but to lose Simba, who had barely begun to live... 

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,959 [Scar]
for me, it is a deep, personal loss. 

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,199 [Scar]
So, it is with a heavy heart that I assume the throne. 

00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:57,259 [Scar]
Yet, out of the ashes of this tragedy, we shall rise to greet the dawning of a new era in which lion and hyena come together in a great and glorious future. Ugh. Oh, Zazu, do lighten up. Sing something with a little bounce in it. No, no. Anything but that. What? What did you say? You know the law. Never, ever mention that name in my presence. I am the king. Oh. Oh, what is it this time? It's the lioness' job to do the hunting. Oh, eat Zazu. Oh, Zazu, don't be ridiculous. All you need is a little drum. What did you say? Good. Now get out. Out. Sarabi! 

00:04:57,259 --> 00:06:04,019 [Scar]
Where is your hunting party? They're not doing their jobs. No, you're just not looking hard enough. They're not going anywhere. Then so be it. I am the king. I can do whatever I want. I'm 10 times the king, Mufasa. Father, no, you're dead. Simba? Simba, [laughs] I'm a little surprised to see you... alive. Oh, Simba, you must understand the pressures of ruling a kingdom. I... oh, oh yeah, I would, naturally. However, there is one little problem. You see them? They think I'm king. Oh, must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member. Wouldn't you agree, Simba? But what about your faithful subjects? Have they put it behind them? Ah, so you haven't told them your little secret. Well, Simba, now's your chance to tell them. Tell them who is responsible for Mufasa's death. 

00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:51,679 [Scar]
You see? He admits it. If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. It's your fault he's dead. Do you deny it? Then you're guilty. Now, Simba, you're in trouble again. But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you, and now everyone knows why. Now, this looks familiar. Hmm. Where have I seen this before? Let me think. Ooh, yes, I remember. This is just the way your father looked before he died. And here's my little secret. I killed Mufasa. No, Simba, please. Truth? But truth is in the eye of the beholder. All right. 

00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,499 [Scar]
All right. 

00:06:54,499 --> 00:07:20,299 [Scar]
I did it. I killed Mufasa. Simba, Simba, please. Please have mercy. I beg you. Don't... Simba, I am family. It's the hyenas who are the real enemy. It was their fault. It was their idea. What are you going to do? You wouldn't kill your own uncle? 

00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:29,959 [Scar]
Oh, Simba, thank you. You are truly noble. I'll make it up to you, I promise. And how can I, uh, prove myself to you? Tell me. I mean, anything. 

00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,259 [Scar]
Yes, of course. 

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:41,679 [Scar]
As you wish, Your Majesty. [screams] Oh, my friend.
